Climbed up all the way to Mt. Vernon despite winds that were clearly stronger than me. Also: shoutout to Mr. Reeds, my art teacher. I used to paint these hills in Diebenkorn style.",

The boys there played some first-person-shooter which I tried out but neither was good nor interested in, so I ended up playing <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkV8PqlMwNc\">Pipe Dreams</a> on someone's old laptop and had a swell time by myself :) Today I tried to find that person's place but couldn't, and instead ended up surprised how quickly outside of Blenheim the feeling changes to 'remote farming area'. I think it's fitting that there are no IG pics for this place!",

We played among the wild riverbanks of Awatere, with eddies sucking us underwater and spitting us out a little downstream, and with building big fires from neophyte plants at night time that turned into castles to be raided. The wineries are private, though, so I didn't manage to access the riverbanks this time around.",

I remember having a small crisis and thinking about where to lie down in case the storm hits me so I wouldn't be the highest point by far.",
