# Your lazy travel blog

Travel blogging is a lot of work. You have to take picture and write stuff, and then publish it somewhere as well!

And it's hard to take good pictures. Maybe, like me, you sometimes just can't be bothered. Also, there's so much great content out there already, right?

This **lazy travel blog builder** helps to create a travel blog by linking to Instagram hashtags of places you went to.

## Lazy lazy version

Just run `make.py` (Python>3.6!):

```python
python3 make.py
```

And type the names of the places you went to into the command line prompt.

That's it. Your `index.html` page is finished and ready to be hosted e.g. on GitHub.

## Less lazy version

You can get a little fancier, while still staying lazy enough.

Create a JSON file name `logs.json` with the following structure:

```json
[
    {
        "title": "your title",
        "text": "whatever there is to say",
        "date": "2019-08-29",
        "tag": "hashtag"
    }
]
```

You can add as many objects to the list as you like to.

Type a sentence as your `text` (or don't), add a `date` (or don't) and give it a `title` (or don't). At minimum you should add an Instagram hashtag under the `tag` key (or don't. it defaults to 'kitten' üê±).

Usually the Instagram tag can just be the place's name. But to be honest, if you're too lazy to add a tag then you should probably use the _lazy lazy version_ described above :)

After creating your `logs.json` file, simply run the script:

```python
python3 make.py
```

Tada! üéâ Your freshly minted travel blog is ready at `index.html` and can be hosted at any static website hosting service, e.g. [here at GitHub](https://martin-martin.github.io/lazy-travel-blog/).
